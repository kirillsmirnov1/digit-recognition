# Digit Recognition

[Hyperskill](hyperskill.org) Neural Network Digit Recognition project.

Consists of several stages which are stored on corresponding branches.

# <u>[Stage 1](https://hyperskill.org/projects/4/stages/15/implement)</u>

Distinguish zeros from ones.

Nine input neurons, one output neuron. Weights and bias are constant.

# <u>[Stage 2](https://hyperskill.org/projects/4/stages/16/implement)</u>

Two-layer neural network. Can distinguish numbers from 0 to 9.

Weights and biases are still set.
